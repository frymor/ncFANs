## About ncFANS

ncFANs is a software to predict functions of genes, especially lncRNAs.ncFANs has introduced a highly efficient way of re-using the abundant pre-existing microarray data. It is expected that the strategies developed in these studies will provide new clues and approaches for the study of lncRNA functions, and the predicted functions will give directions for molecular biological experiments.

## Install ncFANs

## USAGE
ncFANs needs 6 parameters to run correctly, and the information of these parameters is as follows. A demo command is also provided.

### Parameters
* -e expFile

    Expression profile file
* -n noncodingList

    A file with only one column of noncoding gene names
* -c codingList

    A file with only one column of coding gene names
* -g customGo

    A file of the map of gene names and GO IDs
* -t termGO

    A file containing GO information
* -o outDir

  directory to store your results
 
### Example

    cd /your/install/path
    python ncFANs.py -e example/mouse_uniq.fpkm -n example/noncoding.list -c example/coding.list -g /example/human_custom_go -t /example/GOTerm.txt -o /your/outdir/

ncFANs currently supports the analysis of two species of human and mouse species. You can find the corresponding customGO files in the ./customGO_file directory
